OUTER SHELL 91% cotton 7% polyester 2% elastane Which has at least: OUTER SHELL 20% RCS-certified recycled cotton 7% RCS-certified recycled polyester 71% OCS certified organically grown cotton CERTIFIED MATERIALS RCS CERTIFIED RECYCLED COTTON This fiber is made from recycled cotton textile waste. Using recycled materials helps limit the consumption of raw materials. It is certified to the Recycled Claim Standard (RCS), which verifies the recycled content and tracks it from source to final product. Certified by Intertek 193341 More information RCS CERTIFIED RECYCLED POLYESTER Nowadays, recycled polyester is mainly made from PET plastic waste. This is a type of plastic that is widely used in a variety of items, such as plastic bottles. Using recycled materials helps limit the production of virgin polyester fiber. It is certified to the Recycled Claim Standard (RCS), which verifies the recycled content and tracks it from source to final product. Certified by Intertek 193341 More information OCS CERTIFIED ORGANICALLY GROWN COTTON This fiber is produced without using artificial fertilizers or pesticides and is grown from seeds that have not been genetically modified. We are currently working with the Organic Content Standard (OCS) that supervises the process from the source to the end product. Certified by Intertek 193341 More information CARE Caring for your clothes is caring for the environment. Lower temperature washes and delicate spin cycles are gentler on garment, helping to maintain the color, shape and structure of the fabric.
